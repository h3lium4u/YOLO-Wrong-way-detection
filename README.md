# YOLO-Wrong-way-detection
This project is a real-time wrong-way vehicle detection and alert system built as part of a community service initiative to improve road safety and reduce traffic violations. Using YOLOv8 object detection and OpenCV, the system identifies vehicles moving in the wrong direction within predefined polygonal zones in a video feed.
